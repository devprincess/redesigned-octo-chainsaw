       <p>The purpose of this project is to show how can we apply the Actor-Message Passing model from Akka using Play Framework in a web application.
       	  Play Framework ensures that the backend of the application to handle the requests are done using asynchronous calls using Akka internally and 
       	  that it also can handle a great amount of calls without blocking using the Actor message passing model. Of course, to ensure that the framework works this way,
       	  the controllers in this application have been implemented in 2 different ways: In one (LoginController) is the typical use
       	  of a controller returning a Result (That is the way of how Play tipically solves the requests and internally it uses concurrent libraries such as CompletionStage). 
       	  To take advantage of the use of CompletionStage, 2 controllers have been added using this approach: CategoryController and ProductController.
       	  
       	  For the session what has been used is a class called Secured which is an authenticator class that handles the session everytime the user logs in or out. It has also been
       	  considered the case for a timeout in the session. (session time out of 5 minutes due to inactivity)
       	  
       	  For the database what has been used is the Ebean ORM, in which the evolution scripts are being handled inside the conf package of the current project.
       	  (1.sql: for the creation of the tables schema and 2.sql: for the insertion of the initial values in the database)
       	  All the configuration for the dependencies has been set using the Maven pom.xml file and the configuration of the application is specified in the application.conf file of the project.
